This is probably broken.

I wanted to test GDIP, but it keeps giving me errors, on AHKv2. I don't even know if this will do the job I'm trying to do. I don't even know what GDIP should look like, I can't run any demo!

(I think) I fixed some things, now it doesn't throw errors anymore, but I also don't see anything happening.
